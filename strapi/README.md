## Setup

Before you start, install all dependencies and create `.env.local` file which is .gitignored and used for local dev.

```
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You need postgres running locally (with correct credentials & database available). The easiest way to get a postgres db with the right credentials up&running is via `docker-compose.yml` file. Check the readme in the root of this repo.

## Build

Build your admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)

```
npm run build
```

```
npm run dev
```

## Start server

## Set permissions

To allow graphql queries, you need to give access to Public role:

# Project specific config

## Using `patch-package`

We use `patch-package` to apply patches to dependencies.

### @strapi/admin
Strapi transpiled files are located in `./node_modules/@strapi/[package-name]/dist/_chunks` so it's needed to make the changes and run patch-package on every Strapi upgrade.

In Richtext editor, when image is inserted it originally takes only the image's alt text, but not the caption.
We change this behaviour, and we pass caption with alt text as `![alt||caption](url)` so we can use both on the frontend.

Find the proper chunk by searching for `alt: f.alternativeText || f.name`, change it to
``alt: `${f.alternativeText}||${f.caption}` ``
and then run the command to create a patch file:
```bash
npx patch-package @strapi/admin
```
> Note that we use custom syntax, because at that time, we didn't know the proper syntax for caption (=title) in markdown that is `![alt](src "title")`.
